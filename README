The bikeometer project is a arduino-powered cyclometer using a standard ATMEGA328P and a 4D Systems uOLED-128-serial display. It incorporates an OLED serial command library and will have support for a rotary encoder with push for menu operation.
It is still being actively developed, but all the math for speed and distance is available, if someone would like to incorporate it into their own project.
